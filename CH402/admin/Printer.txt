There have been issues with printing in Room 331.

The primary issue appears to be that the name of the printer changes in firmware each time
the printer gets a new IP address from DHCP.  Your instructor knows how to repair this issue,
so if your print jobs fail, please report the issue ASAP.

Your failed job will permanently prevent other cadets from printing from their computers.
If you send something to the printer and it does not print out, the issue might be with
you and not the printer.  So if your print job fails, please be courteous and clear the
print spooler.  

CLEARING THE PRINT SPOOLER:

1.  Click the Microsoft "Start" button on the lower left portion of your main monitor.
2.  Click "settings."
3.  On the left, click "Bluetooth & devices."
4.  Click "Printers & Scanners.
5.  Scroll down to the printer and click it.
6.  Open the print queue and delete any jobs associated with your name.

CONNECTING TO THE PRINTER:

1.  In the search field, type "Printers & scanners."
2.  Wait for the system to refresh and click "Add a new device manually."
3.  Check the radio button for "Add a printer using an IP address or hostname" and click "Next."
4.  In the "Hostname or IP address" field, type "WPPRCLS331" and click "Next."
5.  Click "Finish."
