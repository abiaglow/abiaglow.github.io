SECTION MARCHER (SM) DUTIES AND ROTATION

INSTRUCTIONS:

SMs are chosen alphabetically.  If the SM is absent, the next cadet in alphabetical order is the substitute.  SMs will take attendance, call the section to attention at the start of class, and issue a report to the instructor.

SMs will keep an electronic log of daily attendance using the published electronically-fillable rosters posted on the web page.  A working copy of the SM's roster will be maintained in the SM's SharePoint directory.

SMs are responsible for inspecting and ensuring peers come to class with a professional appearance (clean shaven, uniforms clean, no chewing of gum or food).  SM is authorized and EXPECTED to excuse peers from class until corrections are resolved and other correctional actions.
