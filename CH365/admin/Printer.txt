There have been issues with printing in Room 331.

If you print something and it does not print out, you must clear the print spooler.  
Your failed job will be preventing other cadets from printing from their computers.

Do this as follows:

1.  Click the Microsoft "Start" button on the lower left portion of your main monitor.
2.  Click "Devices and Printers."
3.  Click "Printers" on the main menu and then "Run as Administrator."
4.  Click on the Lexmark printer with the green checkmark.
5.  Clear all jobs from the spooler.

We have been experiencing some network issues.  If you still cannot print at this point, 
the network issues may be the cause.  

You can try re-starting the computer.  This may or may not correct the issue.  I have seen 
this work about half the time.
